Lee Jae-myung is a South Korean politician and lawyer who has served as the 14th president of South Korea since 2025. Lee previously held office as the governor of Gyeonggi Province from 2018 to 2021, as the leader of the Democratic Party from 2022 to 2025, and as the member of the National Assembly for Gyeyang B from 2022 to 2025.
Born to a poor family in Andong, Lee became a factory worker after primary school and became disabled due to workplace injuries. Lee earned middle and high school equivalency diplomas and studied at Chung-Ang University, earning his law degree in 1986. As a human rights and labour lawyer, Lee organized with Minbyun and advocated for opening a new hospital in Seongnam.
Lee entered politics in 2005 and unsuccessfully contested a few elections. He was elected Mayor of Seongnam in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. He first ran for the presidency in 2017, losing the Democratic nomination to Moon Jae-in. Lee resigned as mayor in 2018 for a successful run for Governor of Gyeonggi Province; he would resign as governor in 2021. Lee ran for president in 2022, winning the party nomination, but narrowly losing to Yoon Suk Yeol of the People Power Party in the general election.
In January 2024, Lee survived an assassination attempt. In November, he was convicted of violating the Public Official Election Act by falsely denying his connection with Kim Moon-ki, a former executive of Seongnam Development Corporation, during his 2022 presidential campaign. During the 2024 South Korean martial law crisis, Lee gained international attention for climbing the National Assembly building fence and documenting the event in a livestream. 
He subsequently played a significant role in leading the impeachment against President Yoon. 
Upon the termination of Yoons presidency by the Constitutional Court of Korea, Lee mounted a third campaign for the presidency in 2025, winning the DPK nomination and defeating PPP nominee Kim Moon-soo in the general election. 
The United States of America (USA), also known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. 
It is a federal republic of 50 states and a federal capital district, Washington, D.C. The 48 contiguous states border Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, with the semi-exclave of Alaska in the northwest and the archipelago of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The United States asserts sovereignty over five major island territories and various uninhabited islands in Oceania and the Caribbean. It is a megadiverse country, with the worlds third-largest land area[c] and third-largest population, exceeding 340 million.[k] Its three largest metropolitan areas are New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and its three most populous states are California, Texas, and Florida.
Paleo-Indians migrated from North Asia to North America over 12,000 years ago, and formed various civilizations. Spanish colonization led to the establishment in 1513 of Spanish Florida, the first European colony in what is now the continental United States. Subsequent British colonization, with the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607, saw these colonies expand. Forced migration of enslaved Africans provided the labor force necessary to make the plantation economy of the Southern Colonies economically viable. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and the denial of parliamentary representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776. After winning the 1775–1783 Revolutionary War, the country continued to expand westward across North America, resulting in the dispossession of native inhabitants. As more states were admitted, a North–South division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the Union in the 1861–1865 American Civil War. With the victory and preservation of the United States, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1900, the country had established itself as a great power, a status solidified after its involvement in World War I. Following Japans attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Its aftermath left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the worlds superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries struggled for ideological dominance and international influence. Following the Soviet Unions collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the U.S. emerged as the worlds sole superpower.
The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. 
It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives (a lower house based on population) and the Senate (an upper house based on equal representation for each state). 
Federalism provides substantial autonomy to the 50 states. In addition, 574 Native tribes have sovereignty rights, with 326 reservations composing Indian country. American values are based on a democratic political tradition that draws its inspiration from the European Enlightenment movement. Since the 1850s, the Democratic and Republican parties have dominated American politics.
A developed country, the U.S. ranks high in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, and higher education. 
The U.S. accounted for over a quarter of nominal global economic output in 2024, and its economy has been the worlds largest by nominal GDP since about 1890. 
It possesses the most wealth of any country and has the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries, though U.S. 
wealth inequality is one of the most pronounced in those countries. 
A melting pot of many ethnicities and customs, the culture of the U.S. has been shaped by centuries of immigration, and its soft power influence has a global reach. 
The U.S. is a member of multiple international organizations and plays a leading role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs. 
Documented use of the phrase United States of America dates back to January 2, 1776.
Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, Ima pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfights hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isnt right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cows actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, Thats not a riot; its a feast, lets eat!
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, None shall pass
None shall pass, none shall pass
One for the money, two for the better green
3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine 
Wicked, wicked, wicked on the electroensophonograph
The G-type main-sequence star emits intense electromagnetic radiation across the visible spectrum.
